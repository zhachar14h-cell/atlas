             under the official immutable sampling params (temp 1.0, top_k 20, top_p 0.95, \
             presence 1.5, max 8192, preserve_thinking) plus a pinned seed, and scored \
             in-process by a fixture-verified port of the upstream inline scorer — workflow \
             intent-code match plus coding bash-executable multiset IoU. \
             ★ CANNOT RUN TODAY: the official dataset is unpublished (\"MLCommons storage, \
             link TBD\") and this leg refuses proxies, so it fails loudly at provisioning \
             until the file ships. No baseline exists; the first measured run on main \
             becomes one. Reports inline accuracy + OSL only — the SWE-bench Verified leg \
             of the official three-part gate is a separate live-agent workflow, not a leg.",
