//! Which changes invalidate which gate — the deterministic floor.
//!
//! Before this module there was one bit of information: did the diff touch
//! [`PERF_PATHS`]? If yes, every record for every gate was invalid. That is
//! simultaneously too coarse and too narrow. Too coarse because `PERF_PATHS`
//! contains the string `crates`, so editing argument parsing re-opened two BFCL
//! accuracy legs at roughly three and a half GPU-hours each. Too narrow because
//! a path outside the list invalidated nothing at all, however dangerous.
//!
//! # The polarity is deliberate: exclude, do not claim
//!
//! The obvious design is for each benchmark to *claim* the regions it covers,
//! and to require a gate when a changed path is claimed. That design fails
//! **open**: the moment someone adds a new module and forgets to claim it, it
//! is covered by nothing and silently gates nothing.
//!
//! So this inverts it. Every boundary path invalidates every gate, and the only
//! way to subtract is an [`Exclusion`] carrying a written [`Exclusion::rationale`].
//! Forgetting therefore costs a re-run, never a missed regression — the same
//! asymmetry `mod.rs` already states about the boundary itself: over-broad
//! costs a re-run, under-broad is a lie.
//!
//! # This file guards itself
//!
//! An exclusion table that could exempt the file it lives in would be a lock
//! whose key is kept inside it: a PR could add "exclude everything", and that
//! very edit would trigger no gate. So a diff touching any [`BOUNDARY_FILES`]
//! entry invalidates **every** gate, and a test asserts those files appear in
//! no exclusion set.

/// A path prefix that does **not** invalidate a particular gate.
